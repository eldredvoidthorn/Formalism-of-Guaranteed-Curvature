## Abstract
The FGC framework proposes that gravitational curvature is sourced by the topological stiffness of the vacuum manifold, modeled as a Hopf-fibrated winding current. By identifying the Dimensional Stiffness Factor (gamma = 11/9), we provide first-principles derivations for:

*   **Flat Galaxy Rotation Curves:** Derived from 1/r vorticity decay (Hyper-Drag).
*   **The Hubble Tension:** Resolved as localized vacuum relaxation in cosmic voids.
*   **Proton-to-Electron Mass Ratio:** Derived from the Clifford Torus volume (6π⁵).
*   **The W-Boson Mass & Neutron Lifetime:** Calculated as topological residuals of the 11/9 ratio.

## Core Identities
*   **Reynolds Stiffness Factor (γ):** 11 / 9 ≈ 1.222...
*   **Proton Mass Ratio:** 6π⁵ ≈ 1836.11 (Geometric Knot Volume)
*   **Yield Strength (a0):** c*H0 / (2π*γ)

* 
##  **The Variational Principle (The Action)**
The FGC is a strictly variational theory derived from the Principle of Least Action. The total action of the Vacuum Seal is defined as:

$$ S_{FGC} = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{1}{2\kappa} (R - 2\Lambda) - \frac{1}{4} \gamma (\Omega_{\mu\nu} \Omega^{\mu\nu}) \right] $$

### Components:
*   **$R$**: The Ricci Scalar, representing the curvature of the 4D manifold.
*   **$\Lambda$**: The Cosmological Constant, derived as the **Resting Tension** of the Seal.
*   **$\gamma = 11/9$**: The **Reynolds Stiffness Factor**, representing the dimensional impedance between the 11D bulk and the 9D spatial manifold.
*   **$\Omega_{\mu\nu}$**: The **Vorticity 2-form** ($\partial_\mu W_\nu - \partial_\nu W_\mu$), representing the twist of the winding current.

### Equations of Motion:
1.  **Metric Variation ($\delta g^{\mu\nu}$):** Yields the FGC Field Equation, where the Twist Source Tensor $\Xi_{\mu\nu}$ acts as the primary source of curvature.
2.  **Vector Variation ($\delta W_{\mu}$):** Yields the **Law of Local Conservation**: $\nabla_\mu \Omega^{\mu\nu} = 0$, ensuring the Seal remains topologically closed and energy-conserved.

## Theoretical Resilience & Falsification
The FGC replaces ad-hoc material constructs (Dark Matter/Energy) with a single, scale-invariant geometric constant ($\gamma = 11/9$). 

**Primary Falsification Metrics:**
*   **Lense-Thirring Residual:** Prediction of a systematic ~22% overshoot in frame-dragging (Gravity Probe C).
*   **Post-Merger Echoes:** Predicted secondary reflections in LIGO/LISA merger data due to the non-singular de Sitter core.
*   **Hubble Inconsistency:** Direct correlation between local underdensity (Voids) and an ~8.3% increase in $H_0$.
