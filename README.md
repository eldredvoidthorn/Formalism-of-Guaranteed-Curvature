## Abstract
The FGC framework proposes that gravitational curvature is sourced by the topological stiffness of the vacuum manifold, modeled as a Hopf-fibrated winding current. By identifying the Dimensional Stiffness Factor (gamma = 11/9), we provide first-principles derivations for:

*   **Flat Galaxy Rotation Curves:** Derived from 1/r vorticity decay (Hyper-Drag).
*   **The Hubble Tension:** Resolved as localized vacuum relaxation in cosmic voids.
*   **Proton-to-Electron Mass Ratio:** Derived from the Clifford Torus volume (6π⁵).
*   **The W-Boson Mass & Neutron Lifetime:** Calculated as topological residuals of the 11/9 ratio.

## Core Identities
*   **Reynolds Stiffness Factor (γ):** 11 / 9 ≈ 1.222...
*   **Proton Mass Ratio:** 6π⁵ ≈ 1836.11 (Geometric Knot Volume)
*   **Yield Strength (a0):** c*H0 / (2π*γ)
